Terraform:
    We have multiple tools to use Infrastructure as code using python, shell, Json and Yaml by using the resources from cloud providers suchas 
    AWS --> CFI - Cloud Formation Template
    Azure --> Azure resource manager.

    They provide us with a default template and we can call the services using any of the above provided scripting languages.

    THEN WHY TERRAFORM?

    The company we are working can use multiple cloud providers and we cannt do it and what terraform does is, it supports all the platforms.
    Use Terraform to automate the process on any platform irrespective of the cloud provider. This will be on HCL language.
